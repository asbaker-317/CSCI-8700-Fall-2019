# CSCI-8700-Fall-2019

## Project Description
Video capture, archive, and make videos available (homegrown solution to things like NEST cams but locally and not in the cloud)
Paragraph explaining what it is about

In recent years, there have been many companies pop up who provide web cameras that take video streams and record them in their cloud. With the increase in concerns over corporate security and ownership of personal data, many feel uncomfortable storing their video files in large corporate repositories with the company owning, managing, and securing that data. The target of this project is to develop a simple system that allows for connected webcamers (hardwired or potentially wireless) to feed their data straight into a local server acting as a repository. There should be a simple mechanism for retrieving this data later on by the user for post-recording viewing. A simplistic security system may make sense, but is not high priority as the assumption is the video archive will be resident on the LAN and not available directly to the Internet.

## Several representative User stories
- As a home owner, I want to record videos through web cameras and store them locally in order to avoid using public cloud services
- As a home owner, I want to remotely access my video archives for viewing in order to see what happened when I was away
- As a home owner, I want to minimize the amount of Internet traffic going into and out of my home in ordre to avoid charges from my ISP.
- As a home owner, I want to minimize the amount of space that is consumed by video creating an auto-purge system that deletes / trims / or takes subframe video stills to shrink older video files in order to save drive space.
- As a parent, I want to know when my kid is messing around and doing things aren’t supposed to when I’m at work
- As a business owner, I want to review video playback of injury incident in order to ascertain what happened for incident reporting
